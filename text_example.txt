Falafer Recipe
Ingredients:
1 cup dried chickpeas (soaked in water for 8 hours or overnight)
1 small onion (roughly chopped)
2-3 cloves garlic (minced)
1/4 cup fresh parsley (chopped)
1/4 cup fresh cilantro (chopped)
1 tsp ground cumin
1 tsp ground coriander
1/2 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp salt (adjust to taste)
1/4 tsp black pepper
1-2 tbsp flour (if needed, to bind the mixture)
Oil (for frying)
Instructions:
Prepare Chickpeas: Drain and rinse the soaked chickpeas.

Blend Ingredients: In a food processor, combine the chickpeas, onion, garlic, parsley, cilantro, cumin, coriander, baking soda, salt, and black pepper. Pulse until the mixture is coarse but well combined. If the mixture is too wet, add flour one tablespoon at a time until it holds together.

Chill the Mixture: Transfer the mixture to a bowl and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to help it firm up.

Form Falafel Balls: Once chilled, shape the mixture into small balls or patties, about 1-2 inches in diameter.

Fry Falafel: Heat oil in a deep pan or pot to about 350°F (175°C). Fry the falafel in batches until golden brown and crispy, about 4-5 minutes per side. Remove and drain on paper towels.

Serve: Serve hot with pita bread, tahini sauce, or your favorite dipping sauce. You can also add toppings like lettuce, tomatoes, and cucumbers.
